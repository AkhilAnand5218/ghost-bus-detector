# ghost-bus-detector
ðŸšŒ Ghost Bus Detector A real-time bus tracking and anomaly detection system that helps identify ghost buses (buses that appear on schedules but donâ€™t actually arrive) and other irregularities. This project uses FastAPI, Redis, React, and WebSockets to fetch, process, and visualize bus data on an interactive map.
